# Hotel_Reservation_Payment_System
NTU CE2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming Project

The aim of this project is to design and develop a Hotel Reservation and Payment System (HRPS). HRPS is an application to computerize the processes of making hotel reservation, recording of orders and displaying of records. It is solely used by the hotel staff.

Key Assumptions:
- Currency is in SGD.
- Time zone is set at UTC +8 SGT.
- Payment is always successful (Provided credit card details are always correct)
- No need to log in
- No graphical interface for selection of rooms
- Guest will only make one booking at any Check-In Date
- Waitlisted reservations will always be confirmed when room is available
- Booking reservations will take note of room type but will not assign room
- Guests are only assigned rooms upon check in, subject to room availability.
- Rooms will not be out of service for a lengthy period of time
- Guest details (contact, creditcard, …) are always entered correctly
- Room service can only be made from an “Occupied” room
